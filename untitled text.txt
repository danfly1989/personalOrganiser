In this project, I have created a personal organiser using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  In the html section, a table is created and within it are nested eight sub-tables, one for hours and seven for each day of the week.  The structure of the form used to input data is also created within the html, as well as a colour selector and <input tags> to define the create the “submit” and cancel of buttons, each of which is linked to the correct javaScript function.  Also in the HTML code, is a copy of the script from the cancel button.  This measure was taken when I noticed that the program seemed to work better after clicking the cancel button.  I was unable to locate the exact source of the problem, so this was the best I could do to fix it.

The JavaScript code contains functions that create the visual table columns by extending the cells from their HTML tags.  It also contains a function, courtesy of StackOverflow, which capitalises the headings, which are based on an id on top of each column.  Additionally, the function of each button is defined here, including the create and cancel buttons on the input form and the edit and delete buttons which appear on each appointment.  It should be noted that some JavaScript functionality, particularly the editAppointment function, is based on code provided to me by Brendan Kehoe, though I have changed it significantly in the vast majority of cases.

The css stylesheet, as one would expect, defines the formatting of the document.  The images folder contains the images that display on the edit and delete buttons on each appointment after it is created.
